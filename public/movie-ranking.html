<h1>Malani's Best Movies</h1>
<h2>Top three of all time - according to Malani.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Moulin Rouge</h3>
<p>This film moves me to tears no matter how often I watch. The emotional layering in the music is uncontested.</p>

<h3>La La Land</h3>
<p>I've heard people say nothing happens in this movie - to which I have to respond, "I guess you might be right, if you ate cement as a baby." What a gorgeous film with wit, color, emotional complexity, sacrifice... an ode to the arts.</p>

<h3>Bridesmaids</h3>
<p>Hilarious every time. And I love films that center around women's companionship.</p>
